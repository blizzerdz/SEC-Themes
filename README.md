SEC-Themes
==========

Github for SEC Themes

This is a place for SEC Devs to create themes together..

Rules:
1.When editing on the theme, add comments where you edited. In html <!-- Your comment--> in css /** Your Comment **/.
  This is just so that we all can keep track of the changes. 
2. Do not share the themes public until they are working 100%, only to devs. 

Enjoy
